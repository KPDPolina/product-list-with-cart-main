Transform data without Effects
The TodoList below displays a list of todos. When the “Show only active todos” checkbox is ticked, completed todos are not displayed in the list. Regardless of which todos are visible, the footer displays the count of todos that are not yet completed.

Simplify this component by removing all the unnecessary state and Effects.
